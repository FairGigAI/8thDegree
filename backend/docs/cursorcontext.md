# 8thDegree Project Context

## Project Overview
8thDegree is a freelance marketplace platform focused on fair matching and AI-driven job recommendations, designed for global scale and enterprise readiness.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Architecture
- **AI Layer**: OpenAI-powered matching and bias detection
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Prisma
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (planned)
- **Real-time**: Redis + WebSockets
- **Search**: Elasticsearch + AI embeddings
- **Storage**: AWS S3 with CDN
- **Monitoring**: Separate stacks for development and production

### Database Architecture
