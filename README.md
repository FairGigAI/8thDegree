# FairGigAI
Tired of trying to buy your way to a job on other Freelance and Gig sites? Sick of no one having a support contact? Fead up with random rules about how you can contact each other, or how you can get paid, then forcing you to get paid on their site so you lose 15-25% of your earnings to a platform that already charged you to bid, and charged you to search and charged you to rank up? Don't want to pay your way to getting promoted? 

Yeah, Me Too!
