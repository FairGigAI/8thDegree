# 8thDegree

Tired of restrictive gig platforms that charge high fees, enforce complex bidding systems, and limit opportunities? Sick of unnecessary gatekeeping, pay-to-play ranking, and a lack of real connections between freelancers and clients?

We were too.

## The Open-Source, Fair Freelance & Talent Connection Platform

8thDegree is a **transparent, open-source** platform designed to connect **freelancers and clients** without restrictive fees, complex bidding wars, or unfair policies.
