# Security Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for developers working on the 8thDegree platform.

## Authentication & Authorization

### API Keys
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive keys
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### OAuth
- Use state parameter to prevent CSRF
- Implement PKCE for mobile clients
- Store tokens securely
- Implement proper token refresh flow

### JWT
- Use strong secret keys
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Include only necessary claims
- Implement proper token revocation

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Use TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Implement encryption at rest
- Use strong encryption algorithms
- Properly manage encryption keys

### Personal Data
- Follow GDPR requirements
- Implement data minimization
- Provide data export functionality
- Implement proper data deletion

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits
- Backup encryption

## Input Validation

### API Endpoints
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement request size limits
- Use proper content type validation
- Implement rate limiting

### File Uploads
- Validate file types
- Implement file size limits
- Scan for malware
- Store files securely

### User Input
- Sanitize all user input
- Prevent XSS attacks
- Implement CSP headers
- Validate data formats

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logs
- Log security events
- Implement proper log rotation
- Secure log storage
- Regular log analysis

### Alerts
- Set up security alerts
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Implement incident response
- Regular security reviews

### Metrics
- Track security metrics
- Monitor API usage
- Track error rates
- Monitor system health
