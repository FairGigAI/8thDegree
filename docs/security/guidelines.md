# Security Rules and Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the 8thDegree platform. Our security approach follows a defense-in-depth strategy, implementing multiple layers of protection.

## Authentication

### JWT Authentication
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies
- Refresh token rotation
- Token blacklisting for logout

### Password Security
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt
- Minimum password length: 12 characters
- Password complexity requirements:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### OAuth2 Integration
- Google OAuth2
- GitHub OAuth2
- Secure state parameter handling
- PKCE flow for mobile clients

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per minute per IP
- 1000 requests per hour per user
- Rate limit headers included in responses
- Graceful degradation under load

### CORS Configuration
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  # Frontend URL
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### Request Validation
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Data Security

### Database Security
- Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
- Prepared statements
- Parameterized queries
- Regular backups
- Access control

### Sensitive Data
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- API keys in environment variables
- Secrets managed securely
- Data encryption at rest

## Application Security

### Frontend Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options header
- X-Content-Type-Options header
- Strict-Transport-Security header
- Secure cookie flags

### Backend Security
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Error handling
- Logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates

## Infrastructure Security

### Docker Security
- Minimal base images
- Regular image updates
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only filesystems
- Resource limits

### Network Security
- Internal network isolation
- Firewall rules
- VPN access
- DDoS protection
- SSL/TLS encryption

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring
- Failed login attempts
- Suspicious activity
- API abuse
- System health
- Performance metrics

### Logging
- Structured logging
- Log rotation
- Log analysis
- Audit trails
- Error tracking

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
1. Immediate response
2. Impact assessment
3. Containment
4. Investigation
5. Resolution
6. Post-mortem
7. Prevention measures

### Reporting
- Security bug bounty program
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Contact information
- Response time SLAs

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Data portability
- Right to be forgotten

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10
- CWE/SANS Top 25
- ISO 27001
- PCI DSS (if applicable)

## Development Guidelines

### Secure Coding
- Code review process
- Security testing
- Dependency scanning
- Static analysis
- Dynamic analysis

### Deployment
- Secure CI/CD pipeline
- Environment separation
- Access control
- Secret management
- Backup procedures

## Regular Maintenance

### Security Updates
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security patches
- Quarterly security audits
- Annual penetration testing

### Monitoring
- Real-time alerts
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- User activity
- System health

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. Identify the incident
2. Assess the impact
3. Contain the threat
4. Investigate the cause
5. Fix the issue
6. Document the incident
7. Implement prevention

### Communication
- Internal notifications
- User communications
- Public statements
- Regulatory reporting
- Media relations
